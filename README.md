<h1 align="center">Hi! 👋, my name is George</h1>

<h3 align="center">A software engineer currently in development (and most likely will be forever)</h3>

- 🤝 An apprentice software engineer with **Holiday Extras** learning the ways of code with **Makers**.

- 🔭 At the moment, we are focussed on Ruby, however I have been teaching myself JavaScript since July 2022 when I can.

A little bit about me...
I have a background starting in retail, construction, then served as a Police Officer for 2 years in the South East of England. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with the dog... then family & friends. I train at the gym 5-6 times a week to keep me physically and mentally focussed, especially when looking at pixels on a screen for a large portion of my day. Whenever I can take my motorbike over the car, it will be done... rain or shine (who wants to wait in traffic?).

- 🎯 My personal goal: European road trip on my Kawasaki & travel around SE Asia.
- 🎯 My career goal: TBD. (focus on learning at the moment)
